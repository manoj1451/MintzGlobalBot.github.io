# Order Status Bot

This repository contains the code which is used to build Order Status Bot using node js and LUIS

## Overview
```
User needs to know his Order Status and hence takes help of the Agent Assistant. Order Status Bot helps Agent to give the status of the order which is provided by the user. Instead of going for numerous searches, this bot is directly able to  understand what the user needs and respond back. If the user is chatting with the agent then the bot can listen and give details to the agent so that the agent has the answers right away. No more waiting for the customer, they get  their information accurately and quickly.
